### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a student at the **University of Information Technology - Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City**. Alongside my studies, I work as a **Flutter Developer** at [Pratek Company](https://pratek.vn/).

In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music ðŸŽ¶ and keeping up with the latest tech news ðŸ“±.

ðŸ“« **How to reach me:**
- [github.expenses874@simplelogin.com](mailto:github.expenses874@simplelogin.com)

Here are a few ideas about me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on leetcode, codeforces in this account.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Flutter, Java and Kotlin.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any mobile app or interesting projects.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m a huge fan of both coding and music; theyâ€™re the perfect pair!
